### 👀 I’m interested in:
- AI agents and real-world AI workflows  
- Neuroscience, biochemistry, and their intersection with technology  
- Making tech that’s useful, meaningful, and human-centred  

---

### 🌱 I’m learning:
- Advanced agent orchestration and multi-step workflows  
- React and Next.js for building clean, interactive frontends  
- Better ways to ship full-stack AI products  

---

### 💬 Ask me about:
- Creating AI agents that go beyond chat — with memory, tools, and clear goals
- Collaborating across technical and non-technical teams to build useful tools  
- Turning vague product goals into clear, workable AI designs  

---

### 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Health tech, MedTech, DentTech, EdTech, and anything in between  
- AI tools with a clear purpose and real impact  
- Meaningful, small-scale tools that make a real difference  
- Ambitious projects with focus and depth
