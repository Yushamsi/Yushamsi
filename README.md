🚧 I’m currently working on this page 🙃

👀 I’m interested in AI agents, real-world workflows, and where neuroscience and biochemistry meet tech.

🌱 I’m learning advanced agent workflows and full-stack AI product development.

💬 Ask me about building AI agents with memory, tools, and goals — and turning vague ideas into working systems.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on impactful tech in health, education, and beyond.
